### 1. Snake and Apple Game
In this project, we built a complete **Snake and Apple** video game using the **pygame** module. The game allows the player to control a snake that grows longer each time it eats an apple, while avoiding running into walls or itself. This is a fun way to learn about game development and basic Python programming concepts.

### 2. Document Text Extraction using OCR
In this upcoming project, we will explore **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** to extract text from scanned documents or images. This project demonstrates how OCR works and shows how to implement it using Python libraries such as **Pytesseract**. By the end of the project, you will have a working solution for text extraction from various documents and images.

[Stay tuned for more updates!]
